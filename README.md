<h1>README FOR THE LETS MEET SENIOR CAPSTONE DESIGN TEAM</h1>

<h2>ABOUT</h2>

Let’s Meet is a time coordination mobile and web application that makes scheduling meetings between people fast and easy. Imagine you are in class and you were just assigned to a group of people you don’t know for a project. Class is over and some of the people in your group need to get going, so there is no time to exchange contact information to schedule the first meeting. Using Let’s Meet, one person makes a group calendar with everyone in it that display’s everyone’s schedule and immediately highlights the blocks of time that everyone is available to meet. What used to be a stressful exchange of emails or phone numbers that relied on one person remembering to start a group chat followed by slow moving messages to figure out when schedules match up, now takes less than a few minutes.

Not only is this app great for a group project scenario, it can also be used in several types of settings from offices to clubs to friend groups to families. This will be a great capstone project because it involves a mix of technologies that plays to strengths from the team. Additionally, it presents a solution to a common problem that could benefit society; making people’s lives that much easier. 

This project will generally involve cross development over mobile and web, skills that different team members are familiar with, although there will be some parts that some members will need to learn. Generally it will involve building a database, implementing an AI algorithm to solve the coordination problem, and using a language that allows for iOS, Android and web development.
